The QtCreator works with ROS out of the box but I had some trouble. It also messes up the ROS build environment too which will have been created using catkin-make. For this step to work, we need to build the project at least once so that QtCreator can find the correct build folders. For QtCreator to load the environment variables provided in ~/.bashrc, we need to launch it by creating a custom .desktop file.\nPaste the following contents in to a file on the desktop named appropriately, QtCreator.desktop\n[Desktop Entry] Type=Application Exec=bash -i -c \u0026quot;/home/kalyan/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator\u0026quot; %F Name=Qt Creator GenericName=The IDE of choice for Qt development.
