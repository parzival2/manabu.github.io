      <description>I have an orangepi zero that I want to connect to a ROS instance running on my desktop to play around with manual control on PX4. I have followed some instructions here but they appear not to work for me. The orangepi always says that there is no roscore running. I searched and searched and I came across this page that seems to provide correct instructions. I did it like in the below-mentioned procedure and the orange pi seems to recognize the ROS instance running on my desktop.</description>

      <description>I have tried many IDEs and found that QtCreator is the one that I like. So I wanted to setup QtCreator for ROS development.
Prerequisites Installing ROS I assume that you have already installed ROS on your operating system. If not you can follow these instructions
Installing QtCreator An open-sourced version of QtCreator can be downloaded from here. From here you can only download QtCreator IDE without downloading the Qt framework.</description>
