      <description>Cross compiling a C++ project for Beaglebone I am thinking of getting into Embedded Linux, so I have ordered a Beaglebone. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use Python to program it as I want to do some real-time processing with it. For that, I have to figure out how to compile C++ programs on the host PC instead of doing it on the Beaglebone as it has very little ram.
Initially, I wanted to do the cross-compilation using QEMU but quickly gave up the idea as there is no out-of-the-box QEMU system for Beaglebone.</description>
