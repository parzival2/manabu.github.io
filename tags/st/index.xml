      <description>I want to get into programming Blue-pill using libopencm3 and FreeRTOS. To get started I wanted to compile few test programs to get the feel for it. I needed a flasher as the small board doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an inbuilt programmer like STM32F4Discovery
ST-Link I have ordered a cheap ST-Link that I have found online specifically this. The pinout for this one is
  Bluepill The bluepill connections are as follows from the top right    Pin     GND   CLK   SDIO   3V3   So you just have to connect them according to the name of the pin.</description>
